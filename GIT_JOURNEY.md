## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Production used port 8080, development used 3000
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Different database hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different feature lists and version numbers
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Main branch contained production-only setup; conflict-simulator introduced experimental mode with AI, multi-cloud, and predictive features.
- **Resolution**: Unified into a single YAML supporting **production**, **development**, and **experimental** environments.
- **Strategy**: Kept production as stable default, added experimental configuration under a new environment key.
- **Difficulty**: Hard  
- **Time**: 25 minutes  

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Main had separate dev/prod profiles; conflict-simulator added distributed, AI-optimized experimental setup.
- **Resolution**: Integrated profiles for **production**, **development**, and **experimental** modes with structured JSON.
- **Strategy**: Preserved compatibility for existing deployments while adding advanced backup, replication, and AI monitoring fields.
- **Difficulty**: Medium  
- **Time**: 20 minutes  

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Main used simple environment switching; conflict-simulator introduced AI-powered, multi-cloud deployment.
- **Resolution**: Combined logic into a single adaptive script supporting **production**, **development**, and **experimental** deployments.
- **Strategy**: Implemented conditional checks for `DEPLOY_ENV` and integrated AI pre-deployment analysis and canary rollout.
- **Difficulty**: Hard  
- **Time**: 30 minutes  

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Main monitored basic metrics; conflict-simulator used AI/ML-based predictive monitoring and anomaly detection.
- **Resolution**: Unified the script to support both standard and AI-enhanced monitoring.
- **Strategy**: Added environment-based execution paths; AI features activate when experimental mode is enabled.
- **Difficulty**: Hard  
- **Time**: 25 minutes  

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Main described standard microservices setup; conflict-simulator added event-driven, AI-integrated multi-cloud architecture.
- **Resolution**: Merged into a single document distinguishing between **standard** and **experimental** builds.
- **Strategy**: Retained production clarity while including AI, ML, and multi-cloud enhancements under experimental sections.
- **Difficulty**: Medium  
- **Time**: 15 minutes  

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Main focused on enterprise CI/CD; conflict-simulator added experimental AI-based automation and orchestration features.
- **Resolution**: Combined both versions with clear environment segmentation â€” production, development, and experimental.
- **Strategy**: Preserved production readiness while incorporating new AI-driven enhancements as optional.
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Time**: 15 minutes


## Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**: Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes and experimental features are not production-ready.

2. **Deciding What to Keep**: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**: deploy.sh had completely different logic. Had to understand both approaches before combining.

4. **Testing After Resolution**: Making sure resolved code actually worked was crucial.After resolving conflicts, we verified that the code worked using npm run dev.When it failed to start, we added a missing server.js file to run the server properly.Once added, the app launched successfully, confirming the resolution was complete.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution process
- Understood merge conflict markers
- Learned to use git diff effectively
- Practiced all major Git commands

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides of conflict before resolving
- Test resolved code before committing
- Write detailed merge commit messages
- Use git status frequently
- Commit atomically

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal, not errors
- Take time to understand both changes
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
- Document your resolution strategy
- Keep calm and read carefully

## Reflection
This challenge taught me that merge conflicts aren't scary - they're 
just Git asking "which version do you want?". The key is understanding 
what each side is trying to do before combining them. I now feel 
confident handling conflicts in real projects.

The hands-on practice with all Git commands (especially rebase and 
cherry-pick) was invaluable. I understand the difference between merge 
and rebase, and when to use each. Most importantly, I learned that 
git reflog is a lifesaver!
